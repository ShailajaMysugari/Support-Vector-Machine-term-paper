# Support-Vector-Machine-term-paper
Abstract: The main aim of this term paper is to describe the Support Vector Machine Algorithm, a supervised model used for classification and regression. The paper focuses on SVM for classification tasks only. There are linear and non-linear classifiers available for Support Vector machine. The paper  describes the hard margin and the Soft Margin linear Classifier. The non-linear Classifier is not covered in this paper. The paper also provides the formulations for the data which is linearly separable and not separable. It also describes the properties, applications, advantages and disadvantages of Support Vector Machine.
